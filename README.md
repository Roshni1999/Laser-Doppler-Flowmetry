# Laser-Doppler-Flowmetry

Experiments conducted as part of Advanced BME Lab (AM5019) during December 2021 & January 2022.

## EXPERIMENT: Assessment of blood flow using Laser Doppler flow meter

OBJECTIVES:
i. To understand the LDF system and its components.
ii. Analyze and compare the pulse rate and amplitude using doppler flowmetry experiments at the finger tip and dorsum (bone) region of the hand to distinguish static and dynamic flow.
iii. Analyze and distinguish the signal at the finger-tip when pressure is applied with a cuff to the forearm.
iv. Analyze and distinguish the signal at the finger-tip post exposure to IR radiation.
